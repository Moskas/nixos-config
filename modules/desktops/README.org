#+title: My currently (mostly) configured desktops aka tiling window managers

* Qtile
It's currently my main graphical environment due to it's ease of use and expandability not to mention the fact that I'm just familiar with Python in general.
The config that I use is available [[https://github.com/Moskas/qtile-config][here]]. I tried to keep it in a separate repository to easily use it if I ever have to use it outside of NixOS.
* Hyprland
Experimental config to test out Wayland in my workflow, perhaps it won't be needed if Qtile Wayland will be polished enough (tbh I have never checked the Wayland version as of now).
* Awesome
It's here if I ever feel the need to learn Lua, mostly because it has very cool features like window/widget creation and such but ~ugh~ lua...
